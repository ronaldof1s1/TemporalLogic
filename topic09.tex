    In this week we leaned a lot. 
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Important way of speaking about time and it's properties  with the Introduction to Temporal Logic. \pause
        
        \item How to know if your program is really working with Model Chekcing \pause
        
        \item How to specify time as a linear structure of states and how to reason about it in a logic way with Linear Temporal Logic \pause
        
        \item How to think about time not as a linear structure but as a tree with choices that may modify the state of the future with Computation Tree Logic \pause
    \end{itemize}
    
     This was new to us all. We (in the name of all the seven) hope you enjoyed and learned as much as us.
